Abstract:

Adaptive systems are expected to cater for various operational contexts by having multiple strategies in achieving their objectives and the logic for matching strategies to an actual context. The prediction of all relevant contexts and world facts combinations at the design time is paramount for dependability. However, such a complex task may require advanced techniques such as data mining. The objective is to provide a method to refine the specification of contextual variables and their relation to strategies for dependability. This refinement shall detect dependencies between such variables, priorities in monitoring them, and decide on their relevance in choosing the right strategy in a decision tree. Our requirements-driven approach employs data mining and analysis of simulation data or actual operation history of self-adaptive systems to cope with the large volume of data and potential combinations of variables that affect the system's dependability. We use goal modeling to represent the system various strategies to achieve its goals, and contextual goal model for the mapping of contexts to the system's behaviour. We experimentally evaluated our proposal on a Body Sensor Network system (BSN), simulating a set of resources that could lead to a large context variability space. Our approach was able to elicit subtle contexts that would significantly affect the service provided to assisted patients and relations between contexts, assisting the decision on their need, and priority in monitoring. Even though data mining potentially leads to approximate and partial results, it can mitigate the lack of precise definition of contexts and their relation to system strategies for dependability, being practical and supportive to classic requirements specification methods typically requiring intense human intervention.

  This repository is a vehicle to share the images, datasets, results and other complementary outputs that support the understanding of the method and the replication of the experiments. We structured the repository as follows:

    1 - BSN: Files relevant to the description and representation of the BSN structure and operation, as well as 
    the implementation of a BSN simulation in Python;

    2 - Evaluation Graphs: Outputs from the data mining method, containing results concerning the scalability and 
    the contribution itself;

    3 - Generated Datasets: Datasets generated by the simulated prototype, object of the Data Mining process.
